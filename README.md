## shell-scripts

These scripts are intended for use by experienced Linux administrators and assume familiarity with Bash and system operations. Use them at your own discretion and review any included notes before executing.  Do not run any of these scripts unless you already know what the result will be.  Test in an isolated environment first, if you must.
